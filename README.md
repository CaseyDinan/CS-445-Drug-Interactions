# Drug-Interactions-Project
The objective of this project was to sort through the input files to see if any of the patients were taking narcotics that were dangerous to mix. An additional restriction was treemaps had to be used to store the data in order to deepen understanding of the data structure. The code can be run from the main file DrugInteractions.java, with no command line arguements neccisary. For any questions on the code, feel free to reach out at cdd43@pitt.edu.
